Experiment 1: Simple Linear Regression
This experiment focuses on predicting a continuous target variable using a single feature. It demonstrates the basics of fitting a linear model and evaluating its performance.

Experiment 2: Multiple Regression
In this experiment, we extend the linear regression model to include multiple features. It explores how incorporating more variables can improve the accuracy of predictions.

Experiment 3: Logistic Regression
This experiment involves classifying data into binary categories using logistic regression. It covers the fundamental concepts of logistic models and their applications in binary classification tasks.

Experiment 4: Multi-class Classification
Here, we tackle classification problems where there are more than two classes. This experiment demonstrates techniques for handling multi-class problems and evaluates the modelâ€™s performance across multiple categories.
